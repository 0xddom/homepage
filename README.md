Customizing and adding mascots
----

To customize mascots modify the '.mascotN' classes inside the [stylesheet](style.css)

```css
.mascot1 {
    background-image: url('images/mascots/ruri1.png');
}

.mascot2 {
    background-image: url('images/mascots/ruri2.png');
}

.mascot3 {
    background-image: url('images/mascots/ruri3.png');
}
```

You can remove or add additional .mascotN classes. Javascript will take care of the rest.
